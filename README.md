This miletone focused around choosing a web site to scrape data, what kind of data would be obtained and what potential challenges could I face. I choose 
Harvey Nichols as this was a clothing store which I liked and thought had an interesting selection of data. Potentially challenges identified were the cookie pop-ups and the promotional pop-up box which would appear after visiting the page. The main data I was interested in getting for each item was the:
 - Product number
 - Brand
 - Brand Bio
 - Price
 - Size & Fit
 -
